            "question": "What's the difference between rekeying and replacing a lock?",
            "answer": "Rekeying changes the internal pins of a lock so a new key works with it, while replacing swaps the entire lock mechanism. Rekeying is often quicker and more budget-friendly."
          },
          {
            "question": "What is a master key system?",
            "answer": "A master key system lets one key open multiple locks, while individual keys still open only their assigned doors. It's a popular option for offices, apartment buildings, and properties with different access levels."
          },
          {
            "question": "Do I need to replace my locks after moving into a new place?",
            "answer": "In most cases, rekeying your existing locks is enough to restore full control over who has access. It's more cost-effective than replacement and still ensures that old keys no longer work."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can I upgrade to smart locks without changing my doors?",
            "answer": "Yes, many smart locks are designed to fit standard door preps. We'll help you choose one that works with your current setup."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do I know if my lock needs to be replaced?",
            "answer": "If your lock sticks, wobbles, or shows signs of rust or wear, it's probably time for a replacement. We can inspect it and recommend the best fix."
          },
          {
            "question": "What types of locks do you install?",
            "answer": "We install deadbolts, keypad locks, smart locks, high-security systems, and more—depending on your door type and security needs."
